The app that i have created is a Small website that lists or searches for
Personas (aka the summonable creatures from Shin Magami Tensei's Persona) in
particular, the personas form Persona 4

The design of the web-app is made so that is would be easy to Move around the
app to allow for any user that wishes to use it get around. the main extentsion
of the url are /Persona/<name>, /Search/ and /List/.

/Persona/<name>/
When <name> refers to the name of a persona then it will show the information
of said persona that is stored on the site
If <name> does not refer to a persona then it returns the 404 page error
if <name> is empty then it redirects to the List page

/Search/
when there are no arguments the app offers the user to serch for a persona
If there is a ?q= argument then the app will search for the persona and ether
return with ether the Failed search page or a list of persona that include the
search term

/List/
This just list all the persona with images for the personas to help with
identification

If the site 404 errors then the user is shown the 404 error page with offers
an extra link to get back to the home page

I Believe that, given that i did not give myself a lot of time to complete this
website that i have completed this site to nearly the best that i could have
produced in this time. I would have liked to include a file reading function
that would allow me to read in all the personas from a txt file but I opted for
directly imputing them into a List of dicts for the site to access. The site
could have a better home page that maybe shows off a persona on the home page
to make the home page more welcoming. on top of this have a better search
ultiliy inorder to search for arcana or the personas starting lvl would improve
the user experence

One of the main challenges that i faced was creating a way to get the personas
into the app in a way that would also allow me to easily assess it to search or
list off what is in it. Thanks to this I did learn how to use Python Dicts as
well as how to use multipul lists to zip together to create a Dict and create a
List of Dicts. Past this it was learning about how to use Bootstrap to improve
the look of the web-app.

Resources I used
The Persona4 wikidot to get a complete list of Personas (though i did not
implement all the personas on the list
The Megami Tensei Wikia for images and fact checking
LearnPythonTheHardWay for Learning about how Dicts work.
getBootstrap for Learning some of how to use bootstrap
The Notes & Workbook provided Via moodle for getting started with the whole
program
